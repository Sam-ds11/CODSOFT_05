# Python Projects

This repository contains three Python programs that demonstrate basic functionality and user interaction. The projects are:

1. **Password Generator**: A tool to generate strong and random passwords of a specified length.
2. **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**: A simple command-line game that allows you to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer with score tracking.
3. **Calculator**: A basic command-line calculator that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Password Generator

**Description:**

This script generates a random password based on user-specified length and complexity. It includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to ensure a strong password.

**Usage:**

1. Run the script using Python 3.
2. Input the desired length of the password when prompted.
3. The script will generate and display the password.
4. Optionally, generate another password or exit the program.

**Example:**

```bash
python password_generator.py
```

### 2. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

**Description:**

This script implements a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game where you play against the computer. The game tracks scores for multiple rounds and provides feedback based on the game outcome.

**Usage:**

1. Run the script using Python 3.
2. Input your choice: rock, paper, or scissors.
3. The computer's choice and the result of the round will be displayed.
4. Continue playing or exit the game based on user input.

**Example:**

```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```

### 3. Calculator

**Description:**

This script provides a basic calculator with functionality for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It handles user inputs and performs the chosen operation.

**Usage:**

1. Run the script using Python 3.
2. Choose an operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
3. Enter two numbers to perform the operation.
4. View the result and choose whether to perform another calculation or exit.

**Example:**

```bash
python calculator.py
```
